# University-Projects

The various Python projects I have completed during my degree at Queen Mary University of London. This includes the code for visualisations I used in my Master's disseratation, discussing the impact on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) as a result of varying the level of dark matter in the Universe. There are also projects I submitted as part of coursework for computational modules.

I simulated CMB maps for varying levels of dark matter using the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB); then I compared them to the CMB map generated from theoretical data obtained from the Planck 2018 mission.
