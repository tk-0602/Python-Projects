## University projects
A list of Python projects I completed as part of various coursework at university.

<summary><h3>Thesis - "Modelling the Effects of Dark Matter on the Cosmic Microwave Background"</h3></summary>
I simulated CMB maps for varying levels of dark matter using the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background (CAMB); then I compared them to the CMB map generated from theoretical data obtained from the Planck 2018 mission.
